# TheCube

This project was started on september 24, 2018.  It is wired using React in the front-end, ASP.NET in the mid-tier, and Microsoft Sql in the back-end with tables and stored procedures not having been pushed to this repository.

In order to see what I have so far, you can go to the cube branch.  I plan on updating master once I feel that this project is done.  You can't really clone and see what is going on since I am working on a local database working right now.
